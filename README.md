# CANDY_AVB
## Description
This board is adopted Intel MAX10 series FPGA and Analog Devices SigmaDSP audio codec and then aimed at easier to prototyping and studying with a FPGA based on an audio signal and an ethernet.

I wanted simple FPGA board for sound and music. So I started to develop this board.
